jftt_compiler
=============

One of the most interesting academic project - for a given grammar of simple, imperative language we had to implement a compiler for a register machine code.  Tools needed: Flex (i've been using ver. 2.5.35), Bison (ver 2.4.1), gcc (with -libstdc++ flag)  Documentation's and grammar available in documentation.pdf (in Polish).
